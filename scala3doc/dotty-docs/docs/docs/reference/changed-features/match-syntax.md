title: Match Expressions
---

The syntactical precedence of match expressions has been changed.
`match` is still a keyword, but it is used like an alphabetical operator. This has several consequences:

 1. `match` expressions can be chained:

    ```scala
    xs match {
      case Nil => "empty"
      case x :: xs1 => "nonempty"
    } match {
      case "empty" => 0
      case "nonempty" => 1
    }

 2. `match` may follow a period:

     ```scala
     if xs.match {
       case Nil => false
       case _ => true
     }
     then "nonempty"
     else "empty"

 3. The scrutinee of a match expression must be an `InfixExpr`. Previously the scrutinee could be followed by a type ascription `: T`, but this is no longer supported. So `x : T match { ... }` now has to be
 written `(x: T) match { ... }`.

## Syntax

The new syntax of match expressions is as follows.
```
InfixExpr    ::=  ...
               |  InfixExpr MatchClause
SimpleExpr   ::=  ...
               |  SimpleExpr ‘.’ MatchClause
MatchClause  ::=  ‘match’ ‘{’ CaseClauses ‘}’
```
